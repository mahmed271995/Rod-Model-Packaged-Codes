# Rod Model Code (Packaged)

This repositroy contains Matlab codes for fully computational nonlinear rod model. See [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qwysjxhrmtrw#b7f7cd) for detailed description of the rod model algorithm. The codes are packaged up in a nice way where users only have the ability to change the boundary conditions and
