# Rod Model Code (Packaged)

This repository contains MATLAB codes for a fully computational nonlinear rod model. For a detailed description of the rod model algorithm, please refer to the following [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qwysjxhrmtrw#b7f7cd)
The code is structured for ease of use, allowing users to modify boundary conditions, numerical parameters, and material properties. However, certain critical files are protected to prevent accidental changes that could disrupt the functionality of the model.

Organization is as follows:
1. Linear: Has the packaged codes for considering linear constitutive relationship ($$\vec{q} = [\mathbf{B}] \vec{\kappa}$$)
