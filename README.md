# Rod Model Code (Packaged)

This repository contains MATLAB codes for a fully computational nonlinear rod model. For a detailed description of the rod model algorithm, please refer to the following [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qwysjxhrmtrw#b7f7cd)  
The code is structured for ease of use, allowing users to modify boundary conditions, numerical parameters, and material properties. However, certain critical files are protected to prevent accidental changes that could disrupt the functionality of the model.

Organization is as follows:
1. Linear: Has the rod model packaged codes considering linear constitutive relationship ($$\vec{q} = [\mathbf{B}] \vec{\kappa}$$)
2. Nonlinear: Has the rod model packaged codes considering nonlinear constitutive relationship ($$\vec{q} = \sum_{i=0}^{5} \mathbf{B_i} \vec{\kappa}^i$$) more specifically,  
  $$  \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c} q_1 \newline q_2 \newline q_3 \end{array} \right\rbrace = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c} E I_1 \kappa_1 \newline E I_2 \kappa_2 + a \kappa_2^3 + b \kappa_2^5 \newline G J \kappa_3  \end{array}\right\rbrace $$

```
* Navigate to the `Linear` or `Nonlinear` folder
* Open `main.mlx` and click **Run** to execute the simulation
  - This generates plots, saves variable data, and creates a video file
* **Do not modify** the numerical parameters (`at`, `bt`, `gt`, `as`, `bs`, `gs`), as these ensure the model runs under an unconditionally stable condition. Changing them may cause the simulation to diverge
* The user can adjust the following parameters:
  - Spatial and temporal parameters: rod length (`Length`), spatial step size (`ds`), number of nodes (`N`), time step (`dt`), and total time steps (`nT`).
  - Material properties: Poisson’s ratio (`poiss`), moments of inertia (`I1`, `I2`, `I3`, defined for a circular cross-section), mass per unit length (`m`), and Young’s modulus (`E`).   
* Boundary conditions can be modified in the following files:
  - `leftbound.m` — defines the first boundary condition (currently fixed):
  ```
  v1 = 0, v2 = 0, v3 = 0, w1 = 0, w2 = 0, w3 = 0
  ```
  - `YG_new_direct.m` — defines the second boundary condition (currently sinusoidal bending load):  
   ```
   BV7  = 0, BV8  = 4 * sin(2 * pi * d * dt), BV9  = 0, BV10 = 0, BV11 = 0, BV12 = 0
   ```
    Here, `BV7–BV9` correspond to curvature components ($\kappa_1$, $\kappa_2$, $\kappa_3$) that map to bending moments **q** through the constitutive law, while `BV10–BV12` represent force components ($f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$).
